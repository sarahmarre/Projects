# Projects

Hi there, and welcome to my Projects repo! This is a collection of some projects I've worked on in the last couple of years. The books project is something I'm working on right now for fun to analyze the books I've read since I joined Goodreads a couple of years ago. School projects is a sort of catch-all for things I made while working on my master's degree.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback!
